          <h3>HISTORY</h3>
          <p>
         Despite considerable efforts by governments to persuade farmers to grow ginger commercially, a large-scale Australian ginger industry was not established until the mid-20th century. When the Second World War cut ginger supply from China sales of domestic ginger increased. Five farmers formed a co-op and later built the ‘Merrybud’ Ginger Factory at Buderim, Queensland. At the time it was the only highly-mechanised ginger factory in the world and the only plant in the southern hemisphere where ginger was processed in all forms.
          </p>
          <p>Today the Australian ginger industry is a world leader in producing and bringing food safe quality ginger to the market. The combination of superior quality, food safety regulations and heritage is something of great pride for those involved in the industry.</p>
          <p>AGIA would like to acknowledge the influence by Chinese settlers who also brought ginger to Australia in the early 19th Century to continue their culinary and medicinal traditions.

          <img src="./images/place.jpg" alt="">

          <p>
            The ginger plant is a rainforest plant that needs high rainfall and humidity and rich, volcanic soils. In Australia the ginger growing season begins in August when golf ball sized pieces of rhizomes from previous years crop or from a reputable seed ginger grower is put in the ground. The crop is then carefully watered and looked after until February when the paddocks are a sea of one metre high green grass.
          </p>

          <p>
         By now the plants have formed delicate new rhizomes in large clumps of odd-shaped “hands” under the ground.

            Ginger is one of the most delicious spices on the planet. Adaptable

<img src="./images/gin3.jpg" alt="">
          <p>
           In June and August a late harvest takes place. The rhizomes are now larger and the flavour is “hotter”. This late harvest ginger is valued for its high content of oil and oleo-resins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using ginger can have powerful benefits for both your body and
            brain.

          <p>
          To meet demand most ginger farmers are now harvesting all year round and fresh ginger can be found in super markets and green grocers at all times. The price for ginger remains relatively consistent for most of the year.
          </p>

          <p>Ginger also is available in a variety of other forms including dried, pickled, preserved, crystallised (or candied) and powdered or ground. Your local super market will stock most of these.</p>

          <h4>How to choose ginger?</h4>

          <p>
        Fresh ginger comes in young and mature forms. Young ginger has mild flavour and has a pale, thin skin that does not require peeling.
          </p>

          <p>
           The skin of mature ginger on the other hand is tough and requires peeling. It is either chopped or grated before use. Choose a piece that is firm to the touch, has clean skin and gold skin colour.

          <h4>How to peel ginger?</h4>

          <p>
        The skin is very thin and comes off easily with the right technique. The easiest way to do it is with a spoon. Hold the ginger in your non-dominant hand and run the tip of a spoon down the side and the skin peels right off.
