        <h3>THE AUSTRALIAN GINGER INDUSTRY</h3>

        <p>
          The Sunshine Coast and Wide Bay regions of South East Queensland
          Australia is the main growing area for Australia’s ginger production.
          A sub-tropical rainforest environment and rich soils provide the
          perfect conditions for cultivating 8000 tonnes per year of ginger for
          Australia’s fresh and processing markets. Ginger is also grown in
          North Queensland and Northern New South Wales.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/australia-400x338.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>
          The current farm-gate value of the Australian ginger industry is A$32
          million. This figure represents the value of both the wholesale fresh
          market and first stage processing market in Australia. Total ginger
          production in Australia has averaged 8000 tonnes in recent years, with
          about 60% of production supplied to the Australian domestic fresh
          market and 40% supplied to the first stage processing market.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ginger is a vital ingredient in a wide range of semi-processed
          products for the food manufacturing sector and processed products for
          the retail sector. The value of these products, in which Australian
          ginger is a key ingredient, is estimated at over A$100 million. The
          value of sales of semi-processed and processed ginger products in the
          domestic market is over A$60 million. Exports of Australian
          semi-processed and processed ginger products are currently valued at
          A$40 million.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Australian ginger industry employs hundreds of families by
          providing jobs in farm production, packing sheds, markets, transport
          and farm input suppliers. Australian born ginger food and beverage
          processing companies like Buderim Ginger, Bundaberg Brewed Drinks and
          Gourmet Garden are all significant regionally based employers.

          <h3>FOOD SAFETY</h3>
          <p>
            The Australian ginger industry understands that there is no issue
            more important than food safety and that it is of great concern to
            both processors and consumers. AGIA has developed several protocols
            and procedures to ensure the production of safe, food quality
            ginger.
          </p>

          <p>
            The industry is continually enhancing every step of growing,
            harvesting and transporting ginger. Together with the Australian
            government AGIA invests every year into research that will improve
            quality and food safety systems.

          <h3>BIOSECURITY</h3>
          <p>
            The Ginger Industry Biosecurity Plan (IBP) is a framework to
            coordinate biosecurity activities and investment for Australia’s
            ginger industry. It provides a mechanism for industry, governments,
            and stakeholders to better prepare for, and respond to, incursions
            of Emergency Plant Pests that could have significant impacts on the
            ginger industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of the industry’s biosecurity plan AGIA helps it’s
            members to:
          </p>
          <p>
            evaluate the biosecurity risks within their farming and business
            activities,
          </p>
          <p>
            ginger-smallto formally identify and prioritise exotic plant pests,
            and
          </p>

          <p>focus on future biosecurity challenges.</p>
          <p>
            The ginger IBP was developed in consultation with an Industry
            Biosecurity Group (IBG), a select group of plant health and
            biosecurity experts. The IBG was coordinated by Plant Health
            Australia (PHA) and included representatives from the Australian
            Ginger Industry Association (AGIA), relevant state and territory
            agriculture agencies and research organisations.

          <h3>THE EMERGENCY PLANT PEST RESPONSE DEED</h3>
          <a href="#">CANCELLED – 2021 Ginger Field Day – 14 July</a>
          <p>
            The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD) is an essential part
            of Australia’s plant biosecurity system – providing a binding
            process for government and industry if an emergency plant pest
            incursion occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EPPRD is a formally binding agreement between Plant Health
            Australia, the Australian government, all state and territory
            governments, and AGIA. It covers the management and funding
            arrangements of eradication responses to Emergency Plant Pest (EPP)
            incidents.
          </p>

          <p>
            The EPPRD allowed AGIA to be directly involved in setting up
            framework and to manage an EPP response. It also ensures costs are
            minimised for all parties and growers may be eligible for
            reimbursement of certain costs if their crops or property is
            directly damaged or destroyed as a result of implementing an
            approved response plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The EPPRD shows that Australian ginger industry is seriously
            commitment to risk mitigation, early detection and rapid response
            through the development and implementation of biosecurity strategies
            and programs.
          </p>
